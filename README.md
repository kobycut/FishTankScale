# FishTankScale
This application will be used to determine whether or not the contents of a fish tank are suitable. Determing fish compatibility, water temperature, water ph, water hardness, and tank capacity will be the key features of this application. The main goal for this application is to help all levels of aquarium owners better understand if their fish tank is setup properly and provides the fish with everything they need.
