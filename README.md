# FishTankScale
This application will be used to determine whether or not the contents of a fish tank are suitable. Determing fish compatibility, water temperature, water ph, water hardness, and tank capacity will be the key features of this application. The main goal for this application is to help all levels of aquarium owners better understand if their fish tank is setup properly and provides the fish with everything they need.
## Specification Deliverable
This is the beginning of my Specification Deliverable
### Elevator Pitch
The perfect tool for people who want a fish tank but know nothing about fish. There are many complicated aspects to owning a fish tank of any size. What fish will work together? What temperature should the water be? Can I put a crab with shrimp? How high should the ph be? There are many questions a beginner fish tank owner might have. But with my application, FishTankScale, it will be possible to get help. FishTankScale performs these tasks for you. Just input the size of tank you have, filter, types of fish, and amounts of fish you want, and it will show you the problems that tank might have. It is easy to use and a great way for all levels of fish tank owners to better plan out their next aquarium.
